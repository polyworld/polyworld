This is not intended as a complete TODO list, but it does represent
a good place to start.

In the short term, certain key user interface functionality must
still be revived or newly developed, such as:

* make the main view's camera rotate again 
* get the strip of vision pixels back in the brain monitor window 
* get the overhead view working again 
* get zoom working in the overhead view 
* allow overhead critter following (and toggle on/off, and set fitness rank)
* get the digital movie recording and playback revived (from rev20 or rev21) 
* make dump files work again (to save state and restart the program) 
* make a click on a critter highlight its POV sub-window (new) 
* make a click on a POV sub-window highlight the critter (new)
* make clicks in either place select that critter for brain and overhead
  monitoring (new)

However, the core, scientific simulation engine is fully functional,
I believe.  Longer term goals involve the use of information-theoretic
measures of complexity to assess the neural network dynamics, and,
in turn, to use such measures of complexity as a fitness function
to drive evolution more rapidly (than pure natural selection) towards
neural systems with greater effective intelligence.  Besides measuring
and using complexity in this formal sense, the complexity, now in an
informal sense, of the environment itself will need to be increased
by means such as:

* make food grow in an organic fashion, instead of randomly 
* allow organisms to pick up and put down pieces of food 
* allow organisms to pick up and put down pieces of barrier 
* introduce multiple food types and let an organism's genes
  determine how much it needs of each type 
* introduce geographic trade-offs between energy consumption
  and energy availability

And so on, with all such extensions geared towards providing more
available niches to foster speciation or to provide mechanisms that
enhance the evolutionary usefulness of collaboration.
